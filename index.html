              <p>Welcome to my page!  I am brand new to coding but really excited to be learning.  I have used a program called Articulate Storyline that is for building online learning and enjoyed it very much.  However, I didn not realize how it was related to coding until looking at some coding how-to sites.  While Articulate Storyline is not coding exactly, it requires a similar thought process and that is what sold me. </p>

              <p>  Most of what I know about computers, I've learned pretty much through work. I took a couple of classes while pursuing my undergrad (UR SCPS Class of 2006! GO SPIDERS!) but those were very basic.  In one class, we were required to build a website and present it to the class.  My site was about the artist Frida Kahlo.  She did great work, but not until I was presenting to the class did it occur to me how tragic her life was.  Anyhoo, check out her art.<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fridakahlo.org">Frida's Art</a>
